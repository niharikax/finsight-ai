# FinSight AI

FinSight AI is a multi-agent financial research platform that combines retrieval augmented generation (RAG), vector search, large language models and financial market data.

The platform helps users analyse annual reports, compare public companies, evaluate AI-generated answers and perform broader company research through specialised AI agents.

## How It Works

### RAG Pipeline

When a PDF is uploaded, the application extracts the text, splits it into smaller chunks and converts those chunks into embeddings.

The embeddings are stored in ChromaDB. When a user asks a question, the application retrieves the most relevant chunks and sends them to a Groq-hosted Llama model to generate a grounded answer.

### Evaluation Pipeline

Generated answers are passed to an Evaluation Agent which scores them for faithfulness, relevance, completeness and clarity.

### Stock Analysis Pipeline

The Stock Agent retrieves live market data from Yahoo Finance and displays financial metrics for company comparison.

### Research Pipeline

The Research Agent answers broader company research questions and produces structured financial research summaries.
